# Dream Dwellings Real Estate Website - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Inspired by Housing.com and PropertyWala's clean property showcase layouts and intuitive filtering systems. These platforms excel at presenting property information clearly while maintaining visual appeal and professional credibility.

## Core Design Principles
1. **Trust & Professionalism**: Real estate requires credibility - clean layouts, professional imagery, and clear information hierarchy
2. **Content-First**: Property details, high-quality images, and essential information take precedence
3. **Intuitive Navigation**: Easy filtering and browsing experience for property discovery
4. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design ensuring seamless experience across all devices
